# PHP [iThenticate](http://www.ithenticate.com/)
A library to use **iThenticate** API easier and faster, to check and prevent plagiarism.

### Installation
You can install via **composer** package manager with the following command:

```
composer.phar require bsobbe/ithenticate "*"
```

Or add the following to your **composer.json** file:

```
"require": {
        "bsobbe/ithenticate": "*"
},
```

### Usage
Once the installation is completed, simply use the library with:
```php
use bsobbe\ithenticate\Ithenticate;
```
You will be able to use the library by creating an instance of the ```Ithenticate``` class, make sure you pass your iThenticate API **username** and **password** to the constructor (You might need SSL to connect to the API):
```php
$ithenticate = new Ithenticate("Your username", "Your password");
```
After all simply call each method you want to use with passing the required parameters, and the library will take care of the rest.

I strongly suggest to read the [iThenticate API Guide](http://www.ithenticate.com/hs-fs/hub/92785/file-1383985272-pdf/iTh_documentation/iThenticate_API_Manual.pdf?t=1488585417195) before using the library and its methods.

### Example
Here is one simple example to send new document:
```php
$ithenticate = new \bsobbe\ithenticate\Ithenticate("username", "password");
//The value in result variable is the document_id of the inserted document.
$result = $ithenticate->submitDocument(
                "Cloud Computing",
                "Sobhan",
                "Bagheri",
                "CloudComputingEssay.pdf", //File name from the object of the uploaded temp file.
                $content, //Document content fetched with php file_get_contents() function from the document file.
                649216 //Folder number to store document (You can get folder number from last part of ithenticate panel URL).
          );
```
