# ithenticatewithusersmanagement
New version for iThenticate


A library to use **iThenticate** API easier and faster, to check and prevent plagiarism.
This library is derived from bsobbe/iThenticate
This library takes excellent work from bsobbe and just adds user management and compatibility with PHP 8

### Installation
You can install via **composer** package manager with the following command:

```
composer.phar require joelfan/ithenticate "*"
```

Or add the following to your **composer.json** file:

```
"require": {
        "joelfan/ithenticate": "*"
},
```

### Usage
Once the installation is completed, simply use the library with:
```php
use joelfan\ithenticate\Ithenticate;
```
You will be able to use the library by creating instance of the ```Ithenticate``` class, make sure you pass your iThenticate API **username** and **password** to the constructor (You might need SSL to connect to the API):
```php
$ithenticate = new Ithenticate("Your username", "Your password");
```
After all simply call each method you want to use with passing the required parameters, and the library will take care of the rest.

I strongly suggest to read the [iThenticate API Guide](http://www.ithenticate.com/hs-fs/hub/92785/file-1383985272-pdf/iTh_documentation/iThenticate_API_Manual.pdf?t=1488585417195) before using the library and its methods.

### Methods

#### Submit document
Here is one simple example to send new document:
```php
$ithenticate = new \joelfan\ithenticate\Ithenticate("username", "password");
//The value in result variable is the document_id of the inserted document.
$result = $ithenticate->submitDocument(
                "Cloud Computing",
                "Sobhan",
                "Bagheri",
                "CloudComputingEssay.pdf", //File name from the object of the uploaded temp file.
                $content, //Document content fetched with php file_get_contents() function from the document file.
                649216 //Folder number to store document (You can get folder number from last part of ithenticate panel URL).
          );
```

#### Get document data
```php
$ithenticate = new \joelfan\ithenticate\Ithenticate("username", "password");
$result = $ithenticate->documentGetRequest(12345);
// Since we are requesting 1 document, there should be 1 document only in the response.
$document = reset($result['documents']);
$is_pending = $document['is_pending']; // If the report is pending.
$document_id = $document['id'];
$processed_time = $document['processed_time']; // The time the report has been created.
$percent_match = $document['percent_match']; // The percentage match for the document.
$title = $document['title']; // The submitted title of the document.
$uploaded_time = $document['uploaded_time']; // The time the document was uploaded.

// Also, $document['folder'] is available containing information related to the folder that the document is submitted
// into.
```

#### Get report data
```php
$ithenticate = new \joelfan\ithenticate\Ithenticate("username", "password");
$result = $ithenticate->reportGetRequest(98765, 1, 1, 1); // The report ID.

$view_only_url = $result['view_only_url'];
$view_only_expires = $result['view_only_expires'];
$report_url = $result['report_url'];
```
